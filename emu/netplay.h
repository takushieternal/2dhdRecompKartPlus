// netplay: delay-based lockstep netplay for two players over UDP.
//
// Both sides run the same deterministic emulation. Every frame each side sends its controller
// state for frame f+delay; frame f only runs once both inputs for f are known. The host is
// player 1, the client player 2. On connect the host sends its SRAM and both machines power-cycle,
// so they start from identical state. A WRAM hash is exchanged every 60 frames to detect desyncs.
